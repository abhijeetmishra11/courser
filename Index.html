		ACADGILD is a technology education startup that aims to create an ecosystem for skill development in
which people can learn from mentors and from each other. We believe that software development
requires highly specialized skills that are <strong> best learned</strong> with guidance from experienced practitioners.
Online videos or classroom formats are poor substitutes for building real projects with help from a
dedicated mentor. Our mission is to teach hands-on, job-ready software programming skills, globally,
in small batches of 8 to 10 students, using industry experts.
